              These are the official rules (terms and Conditions) that govern how the LimitIRSTD challenge on the resource-limited infrared small target detection will operate. This challenge will be simply referred to as the “challenge” or the “contest” through the remaining part of these rules and may be named as “LimitIRSTD” benchmark, challenge, or contest, elsewhere (our webpage, our documentation and publications.)

          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-12" > 
              In these rules, “we”, “our” and “us” refer to the organizers of this challenge, and “you” refers to an eligible contest participant.

              Note that, these official rules can change during the contest until the start of the final phase. If, at any point during the contest, the registered participant considers that they cannot anymore meet the eligibility criteria or does not agree with the changes in the official terms and conditions, it is the responsibility of the participant to send an email to the organizers such that to be removed from all the records. Once the contest is over, no change will be made to the status of the registered participants and their entries.

To enter the final ranking, the participants will need to fill out a survey (fact sheet) briefly describing their method. All the participants are also invited (not mandatory) to submit a paper for peer-reviewing and publication at the ICPR Workshop and Challenges. The participants' scores must improve the baseline performance provided by the challenge organizers (Baseline model waiting for release).

A list of the judges will be made available upon request. The judges will review all eligible entries received and select three winners for each of the two competition tracks based on the prediction score on test data. The judges will verify that the winners complied with the rules, including that they documented their method by filling out a fact sheet.
